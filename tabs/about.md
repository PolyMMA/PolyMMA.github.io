Hello,


Welcome to my private tech blog. I am interested in a bunch of different technology- and natural science areas. Currently, I am focusing on SW dev, mostly in Python but in time perhaps also in other languages. I also have a background in natural sciences, particularly physics, chemistry and biotechnology. When possible, I also like tinkering with electronics, often modifying or reverse-engineering existing technology to learn, re-purpose and develop new features.

The content of this blog will reflect these interests, and perhaps some other thoughts and rants :-)
